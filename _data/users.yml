    Amazon Web Services (AWS) is widely used for deploying and running Trino.
    Amazon Athena or Amazon EMR embed Trino for your usage.

    **Amazon Athena** is a serverless, interactive analytics service built on
    open-source frameworks, supporting open-table and file formats. Athena
    provides a simplified, flexible way to analyze petabytes of data where it
    lives. Analyze data or build applications from an Amazon Simple Storage
    Service (S3) data lake and 30 data sources, including on-premises data
    sources or other cloud systems using SQL or Python. Athena is built on
    open-source Trino and Presto engines and Apache Spark frameworks, with no
    provisioning or configuration effort required.

    **Amazon EMR** provides a managed Hadoop framework that makes it easy, fast,
    and cost-effective to process vast amounts of data across dynamically
    scalable Amazon EC2 instances. With EMR, you can launch a large Trino
    cluster in minutes. You don't need to worry about node provisioning, cluster
    setup or tuning. Using Trino on EMR provides these benefits to customers:

    * Elasticity: With Amazon EMR, you can provision one, hundreds, or
    thousands of compute instances to process data at any scale. You can easily
    increase or decrease the number of instances manually or with auto scaling,
    and you only pay for what you use.
    * Simple and predictable pricing: You pay a per-second rate for every second
    used, with a one-minute minimum charge.
