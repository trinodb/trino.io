Presto nation, We want to hear from you! If you have a question or pull request 
that you would like us to feature on the show please join the 
[Trino community chat](slack.html) and go to the 
\#trino-community-broadcast channel and let us know there. Otherwise, you can 
message Manfred Moser or Brian Olsen directly. Also, feel free to reach out
to us on our Twitter channels Brian 
[@bitsondatadev](https://twitter.com/bitsondatadev) and Manfred 
[@simpligility](https://twitter.com/simpligility).

Today’s concept covers a big overview of what Presto is for those that are new
to Presto. For mor information about Presto, check out the following resources:

In this PR we covered [pull request 5163]({{site.github_repo_url}}/pull/5163)
which is actually just a documentation update around the existing
experimental features of the WITH RECURSIVE feature. The extended development of
this feature is still being tracked and documented in 
[issue 1122]({{site.github_repo_url}}/issues/1122). As with many 
problems in recursion, the solution space typically exponentially increases and
so it is something that can easily be misused and cause problems. We run the 
query and discuss it as well as some of the things that can go wrong. Check out
 he pull request to see more documentation that was added around it.

In the question of the week, we covered a lot of the confusion around the hive
connector({{site.url}}/docs/current/connector/hive.html). Feel free to 
try out the katacoda example I created and will be nesting within an 
[intro to the hive connector blog](blog/2020/10/20/intro-to-hive-connector.html).
This is running on a non-paid katacoda account so resources are scarce at times
and it may take a while to load. Nevertheless, the information written around it
will help you quickly have a Presto environment to play with.
