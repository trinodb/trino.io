## Concept of the week: Apache Iceberg and the table format

### The Hive table format

For the last decade or so, big data professionals' only option to query their 
data was to, in some way shape or form, use the Hive model. The Hive model is
very simple, but it enabled running queries over files in a distributed file
system. 

To accomplish this, Hive uses a metastore service which stores and manages
metadata. For Hive and Trino, this metadata acts as a pointer to the files
containing the data, contains the file format, and has the column structure and
types. This enabled Hive to query the correct files and data within those files
for a SQL query. For more information on Hive's architecture, read the
[Gentle Introduction to Hive]({% post_url 2020-10-20-intro-to-hive-connector %})
blog. After the initial model gained adoption, Hive added other features such as
partitioning. It uses the directory structures of the filesystems to split the 
files of data partitioned on a special column into different directories. We 
talk about this in more depth [a few episodes back](/episodes/5.html).

The Hive model solved some initial issues facing engineers in big data, but 
there were quite a few issues with this model. It is very rigid and not able
to adapt to your needs as requirements change. For example, if you started
partitioning your data splitting by date and segmenting by month, that table is
stuck with that partitioning forever. The only way to update it is to create a
new table with your new partition values, and migrate all of your data from
the old table to the new table. With the common data sizes such a migration is 
often a long process, sometimes even impossible. Another issue stems from the 
separation of data stored in the metastore and data stored in the file system. 
The source of many issues in Hive is caused by the Hive metastore getting out of
sync. A third but not final issue, is that running operations against the 
metastore is a timely process when running operations like list files on more 
modern object storage. 

As all these problems amassed over the years, clearly something needed to be 
done. In the last few years, a few candidate table formats have come to the 
forefront of data engineering trends. Examples are, Apache Iceberg, Apache Hudi,
and the proprietary Databricks' Deltalake. The goal of these systems is to 
modernize the old Hive data structure. To Trino, Iceberg is particularly 
promising due to the list of promising features like schema versioning support 
and hidden partitioning that made it particularly attractive. Let's talk about 
some of these features in detail.

### The Iceberg table format

Iceberg, is a new table format developed at Netflix that aims to replace older 
table formats like Hive to add better flexibility as the schema evolves, atomic
operations, speed, and just dependability. To be clear, it's not a new file
format, as it still uses ORC, Parquet, and Avro, but a table format. Netflix 
donated Iceberg to the Apache Software Foundation and it is now a top level
project! 

Iceberg handles both the data on disk just like Hive, but instead it stores the
metadata in manifest files on disk along with the data itself. These *manifest 
files* are AVRO files that contain table metadata that lists a subset of data 
files. *Manifest lists* are a special type of manifest file that point to other 
manifest files. *Snapshots* contain a manifest list that points to all the 
manifest files that belong to the snapshot. Another huge difference from Hive is
that the manifest files keep track of table data at the file level as opposed to
directory level that Hive uses. By doing so, Iceberg avoids having to list all 
files in a directory, which becomes a very common and expensive operation.
 
<p align="center">
  <img align="center" width="60%" height="100%" src="/assets/episode/14/iceberg-metadata.png"/><br/>
</p>
 
By tracking files this way, we not only get better performance from object
storage, it also enables serializable isolation. This addresses the lack of
consistency between the metadata and file state experienced in Hive.

One of the greater advantages to Iceberg over Hive is the in-place table
evolution. This means that you can add, drop, or rename a column, as well as, 
reorder and update a column without any expensive refactoring of tables or 
moving data around and there is no adverse effects on your data or metadata.

Partition evolution and hidden partitions are particularly invaluable. In 
Iceberg, the *partition spec* is a description of how to partition data in a 
table consisting of a list of source columns and transforms. Once the spec is 
created, it generates a partition tuple that is applied uniformly to the files 
created with that spec. Unlike Hive, that requires you to modify and send a 
special column that acts as the partition value, Iceberg stores partition values
unmodified. Here's an example partition spec generated in the Java API.

```
PartitionSpec spec = PartitionSpec.builderFor(schema)
        .hour("event_time")
        .identity("level")
        .build();
```

This example creates a separate hourly partition on the `event_time` field and 
use the `identity()` function on level to generate another level of partitioning
on the `level` field. If at a later time, you decide you are getting too many 
small files because your partitions are too small, then you  can update the 
partition spec and Iceberg starts writing new files by the updated spec. 
Again, this is all without creating a new table and moving data around and all 
the queries return correctly. This kind of evolution is a problem with Hive.

<p align="center">
  <img align="center" width="60%" height="100%" src="/assets/episode/14/partition-spec-evolution.png"/><br/>
</p>

If all that isn't enough, you can also do time travel and version rollback with
Iceberg. As we mentioned above, Iceberg keeps track of various snapshots of 
your data in time through manifest files. As long as you keep those older 
snapshots around, the files associated with those snapshots stick around as 
well. This allows you to move around to previous views of the data. This is 
useful for testing, recovery, and many other purposes. Just as
you can time travel, you can make the time travel permanent by rolling back
any unintended changes and deleting the undesired snapshot.

Iceberg is also able to offer fast scan planning by filtering out the metadata
files that are irrelevant to the scan, and using the partition spec to only find
files containing responses to the data. Iceberg filters the metadata using
partition value ranges and seeing if that is contained within the files of
the metadata. Then while processing the list of manifest files, Iceberg will
filter files by query predicates included in the partition, then apply column
stats to help prune out files that don't match. Iceberg also uses multiple
concurrent writers to speed things up as a final measure.

Saving the best for last; Iceberg is a community standard and has 
[a full written specification](https://iceberg.apache.org/spec/) which is a nice
change from Hive which is an ad-hoc specification that people adhere to in some 
ways. There have been many issues over the years due to the variance of how the
unwritten specification gets interpreted. This not only enables people to 
understand how to use it, but documents how others can implement the same
features with an entirely different systems. Let's wait to do a deep dive on the
spec for the next episode when we bring on Ryan Blue, creator of Iceberg, to dig
into these details.

## PR of the week: PR 1067 Add Iceberg connector

A huge shoutout goes to [Parth Brahmbhatt](https://github.com/Parth-Brahmbhatt),
a Senior Software Engineer at Netflix who created this weeks' 
[PR of the week](https://github.com/trinodb/trino/pull/1067).

[Release 318](/docs/current/release/release-318.html), 
introduced this code that supported querying tables from Apache Iceberg in
Trino. While the code existed, the Iceberg connector code wasn't officially
released or documented until a little over a year later in 
[release 341](/docs/current/release/release-341.html) once the connector reached
maturity. 

### Future development for the Trino Iceberg connector

Still, some strange artifacts that we're still facing today in the connector.
For instance, if you create a table with the Iceberg Java API, [it creates
Iceberg tables with <table_type, ICEBERG>](https://github.com/apache/iceberg/blob/996ed979f396f2c7cc12ca824a3fe758f2c486ce/hive/src/main/java/org/apache/iceberg/hive/HiveTableOperations.java#L222)
but Trino [creates and reads with <table_type, iceberg>](https://github.com/prestosql/presto/blob/master/presto-iceberg/src/main/java/io/prestosql/plugin/iceberg/HiveTableOperations.java#L190).
See [Issue 1592](https://github.com/trinodb/trino/issues/1592) for status and 
details. In general, we can track some of the broader changes that are being 
made to [the Iceberg connector here](https://github.com/trinodb/trino/issues/1324).

## Demo: Creating tables with Iceberg and reading the data in Trino

For this weeks' demo, I wanted to play around with the Iceberg Java API directly.
You also have the option to use Trino, Spark, or other to ingest and query the
data, but I wanted to use vanilla Iceberg API's to experience the API and
hopefully solidify my learning of Iceberg concepts in the process. Make sure you
follow the instructions in the repository if you don't have Docker or Java
installed.

Let's start up a local Trino coordinator and Hive metastore. Clone this 
repository and navigate to the `iceberg/trino-iceberg-minio` directory. Then
start up the containers using Docker Compose.

```
git clone git@github.com:bitsondatadev/trino-getting-started.git

cd iceberg/trino-iceberg-minio

docker-compose up -d
```

In your favorite IDE, open the files under `iceberg/iceberg-java` into your
project and run the `IcebergMain` class.

This class creates a logging table if it doesn't exist. Once you run this code,
you can check to see that the table in Trino exists in the metastore under
TABLE_PARAMS. But, if run `SHOW TABLES IN iceberg.logging;` you'll notice that
the table doesn't show up due to [the issue we discussed above](https://github.com/trinodb/trino/issues/1592).

Let's update the TABLE_PARAMS entry in the metastore db and then query the table
again.

## Question of the week: Why does Trino still depend on the Hive metastore if metadata for Iceberg saves to the filesystem?

We kept the metastore as many tests run around using the metastore that exist
for the Hive connector, and we want to give the Iceberg connector ample time to
mature before we migrate entirely away from the metastore. We also wanted to 
make the metastore the initial method of use in Iceberg that got developed as
most developers initially would be migrating from their existing Hive catalog,
and we wanted this transition to use existing tested components.

Currently, the metastore isn't used the same way as in Hive. Trino stores a
top-level directory that points to the metadata manifest file location and other
statistics around the table in the TABLE_PARAMS table of the metastore. There
is a [pull request created by Jack Ye](https://github.com/trinodb/trino/pull/6977)
to migrate away from the requirement to use the Hive metastore when using 
Iceberg with Trino.

## Tip of the Iceberg

Last bit of some fun with Iceberg. Let’s do a little experiment called, “Will 
the iceberg tip?”:
 1. Go to <https://iceberg.apache.org/> and take a look at the logo.
 2. Now go to <https://joshdata.me/iceberger.html>.
 3. Draw the Apache Iceberg logo and see what happens.
 4. Now draw the iceberg in the image above that Commander Bun Bun is on.
 
When drawing the iceberg like the image with Commander Bun Bun, the iceberg tips
over. Careful Commander Bun Bun! It looks like the Apache logo wins! Shout out 
to [Joshua Tauberer](https://twitter.com/JoshData) for the web page. Shout out 
to [Megan Thompson-Munson](https://twitter.com/GlacialMeg) for the tweet that 
started the page. Shout out to 
[Barton Wright](https://www.linkedin.com/in/bartonwright/) from Manfred's team 
of writers for being the geek to find this. Shout out to 
[Ali](https://twitter.com/aliLoney) for being a good sport and setting Command 
Bun Bun on the iceberg.
