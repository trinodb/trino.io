## Concept of the week: Apache Iceberg and the Iceberg spec

### Interview with Ryan Blue

In [the previous episode](/episodes/14.html), we covered the 
differences between the Iceberg table format, and the Hive table format from a 
technical standpoint in the context of Trino. We highly recommend watching it
before this episode. In this episode we ask Ryan about the origins of Apache 
Iceberg and why he started the project. We cover some details of the 
[Iceberg specification](https://iceberg.apache.org/spec/) which is a nice change
from the ad-hoc specification that people adhere to when using Hive tables. Then
Ryan dives into several amazing use cases how Netflix and others use Iceberg.

## PR of the week: PR 7233 Fix queries on tables without snapshot id

This week's [PR of the week](https://github.com/trinodb/trino/pull/7233) was 
submitted by one of the Trino maintainers,
[Pratham Desai](https://twitter.com/desai_pratham). Pratham is a Software 
Engineer at LinkedIn who commits a lot of time in the Trino community helping
out on the slack channel, contributing code, and doing PR reviews. Thank you for
all you do Pratham!

Had Brian known about this PR, he wouldn't have had the issue he did with 
reading the empty snapshot created with the Iceberg Java API and would have been 
able to read and insert into the table just fine. If you come across this issue,
we introduced this feature in 
[release 344](/docs/current/release/release-344.html)! 

### Another future development for the Trino Iceberg connector

Along with the future developments we discussed in the previous episode, another
core Iceberg functionality that we want to add in Trino is support for
[partition migration](https://github.com/trinodb/trino/issues/7580). We also 
discussed future support for `UPDATE` and `MERGE` capabilities for the Iceberg 
connector.

## Demo: Creating tables with Iceberg and reading the data in Trino

For this weeks' demo, we continue to use the Iceberg Java API to create a table.
You also have the option to use Trino, Spark, or other to ingest and query the
data, but I wanted to use vanilla Iceberg API's to experience the API and
hopefully solidify my learning of Iceberg concepts in the process. Make sure you
follow the instructions in the repository if you don't have Docker or Java
installed.

Let's start up a local Trino coordinator and Hive metastore. Clone this 
repository and navigate to the `iceberg/trino-iceberg-minio` directory. Then
start up the containers using Docker Compose.

```
git clone git@github.com:bitsondatadev/trino-getting-started.git

cd iceberg/trino-iceberg-minio

docker-compose up -d
```

In your favorite IDE, open the files under `iceberg/iceberg-java` into your
project and run the `IcebergMain` class.

This class creates a logging table if it doesn't exist along with the logging 
schema. Once you run this code, you can check to see that the table in Trino 
exists in the metastore under `TABLE_PARAMS`. 

Now we transition from the Java API to running queries over Iceberg using Trino.

```
/**
 * This is the equivalent of running IcebergMain in the iceberg-java project.
 * Go ahead and inspect the java code you can use to interact with Iceberg
 * tables and metadata.
 */
CREATE TABLE iceberg.logging.logs (
   level varchar NOT NULL,

## Question of the week: What do I do to restart the test pipeline if it fails on me?

When developing with Trino, there is an automated build that acts as 
verification of any PR. It is powered by a GitHub actions definition and runs 
all the tests in Trino when developers add new code. Sometimes test unrelated to
the changes in your PR fail, which makes your PR show that it shouldn't be 
merged due to a failure, but is actually unrelated. 

Developers are aware of these flaky tests, and need a mechanism to resubmit 
their PR and rerun the tests. There is unfortunately no way to enable users to 
rerun tests through GitHub without write permissions to the Trino repository, so
you have to do a dummy commit.

This can easily be done using this one line hack 
`git commit --amend --no-edit && git push -f`.

The good news is, we have gone through some extensive lengths to identify flaky
tests in the last year. These test failures are much rarer now, and we are 
constantly improving the build stability as an ongoing effort.

## Events, news, and various links

### WTD Portland

Interested in supporting the Trino project, but don't know where to start? A 
good place to start with a little less barrier to entry, is adding to the 
documentation. We will be supporting the 
[writing day](https://trino.io/blog/2021/04/14/wtd-writing-day.html) at the
Write the Docs (WTD) Portland conference this April! Join us to learn how to get involved!

### Virtual Trino meetups

Come join us for the inaugural Virtual Trino meetup on April 21st in the virtual
meetup group in your region! See [the community page](./community.html) for more
details.

 - [Trino Americas meetup](https://www.meetup.com/trino-americas/events/277246268/)
