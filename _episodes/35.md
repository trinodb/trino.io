Additional highlights worth a mention according to Manfred:

* Generally lots of improvements on Hive, Delta Lake, Iceberg, and main
  JDBC-based connectors.
* Full Iceberg v2 table format support for read and later read and write
  operations is getting closer and closer.

  encoded.
* Add new page to display the runtime information of all workers in the cluster
  in Web UI.
* Remove `user` property requirement in JDBC driver.
* Require `internal-communication.shared-secret` value with authentication
  usage, breaking change for many users that have not set that secret.

## Concept of the episode: Packaging Trino

To adopt Trino you typically need to run it on a cluster of machines. These can
be bare metal servers, virtual machines, or even containers. The Trino project
provides a few binary packages to allow you to install Trino:

* tarball
* rpm
* container image

All of them include a bunch of Java libraries that constitute Trino
and all the plugins. As a result there are only a few requirements. You need a
Linux operating system, since some of the libraries and code require Linux
indirectly, and a Java 11 runtime.

Beyond that is just the `bin/launcher` script, which is highly recommended, but
not required. It can be used as a service script or for manual
starts/stop/status of Trino, and only needs Python.

### Tarball

The tarball, is a gz compressed tar archive. For installation you just need to
extract the archive anywhere. It contains the following directory structure.

* `bin`, the launcher script and related files
* `lib`, all globally needed libraries
* `plugins`, connectors and other plugins with their own libraries each in
  separate sub-directories

You need to create the `etc` directory with the needed configuration, since the
tarball does not include any defaults, and you can not start the application
without those.

* `etc/catalog/*.properties`
* `etc/config.properties`
* `etc/jvm.config`
* `etc/log.properties`
* `etc/node.properties`

Note that all the files are within the created directory.

### RPM

The RPM archive is suitable for RPM-based Linux distributions, but testing is
not very thorough across different versions and distributions.

It adapts the tarball content to the Linux file system hierarchy, hooks the
launcher script up as daemon script, and adds default configuration files. That
allows you to start Trino after installing the archive, as well as with system
restarts.

Locations used are `/etc/trino`, `/var/lib/trino`, and others. These are
configured via the launcher script parameters.

In a nutshell the RPM adds some convenience, but narrows down the supported
Linux distributions. It still requires Java and Python installation and
management.

### Container image

The container image for Trino adds the necessary Linux, Java, and Python, and
adapts Trino to the container setup.

The container adds even more convenience, since it is ready to use out of the
box. It allows usage on Kubernetes with the help of the [Helm
charts](https://github.com/trinodb/charts), and includes the required operating
system and application parts automatically.

### Customization

All three package Trino ships are just defaults. They all require further
configuration to adapt Trino to your specific needs in terms of hardware,
connected data sources, security configuration, and so on. All of these can be
done manually or with many existing tools.

However, you can also take it a step further and create your own package suited
to your needs. The tarball can be used as source for any customization to create
your own package. In the following is a list of options and scenarios:

* Use the tarball, but remove unused plugins.
* Use the tarball as source to create your own specific package. For example a
  deb archive for usage with Ubuntu, or an Alpine package for that same distro.
* Create your own RPM similar to [Manfred's proof of
  concept](https://github.com/simpligility/trino-packages) that pulls out the
  Trino RPM package creation into a separate project.
* Create your own container image with different base distro, custom set of
  plugins, and even with all your configuration baked into the image.

### Others

You can also use [brew on MacOS](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/trino), but
that is not suitable for production usage. More for convenience to get a local
Trino for playing around.

## Additional topic of the episode: Modernizing Trino with Java 17

Currently Java 11 is required for Trino. Java 17 is the latest and greatest Java
LTS release with lots of good performance, security, and language improvements.
The community has been working hard to make Java 17 support a reality. At this
stage core Trino fully supports Java 17. Starburst Galaxy for example uses Java
17.

The maintainers and contributors would like to move to fully support and also
require Java 17 soon. Here is where your input comes in, and we ask that you
let us know your thoughts about questions such as the following:

* Are you looking forward to the new Java 17 language features and other
  improvements as a contributor to Trino?
* Are you already using Java 17 with Trino? In production or just testing?
* If we require Java 17 in the next months, can you update to use Java 17 with
  Trino?
* If not, what are some of the hurdles?
* Are you okay with staying at an older release, until you can use Java 17?

Let us know on the #dev channel on Trino Slack or ping us directly. You can also
chime in on the [roadmap issue](https://github.com/trinodb/trino/issues/9876).

## Pull requests of the episode: Worker stats in the Web UI

The [PR of the episode](https://github.com/trinodb/trino/issues/11653) was
submitted [Github user whutpencil](https://github.com/whutpencil), and adds a
significant new feature to the web UI. It exposes the `system.runtimes.nodes`
information, so statistics for each worker, in brand new pages. What a great
effort! Special thanks also go out to [Dawid Adamek
`dedep`](https://github.com/dedep) for the review.

## Demo of the episode: Tarball installation and new Web UI feature

In the demo of the month Manfred shows a worker installation to add to a local
tarball install of a coordinator, and then demos the Web UI with the new feature
from the pull request of the month.

## Question of the episode: Are write operations in Delta Lake supported for tables stored on HDFS?

[Full question from Slack](https://trinodb.slack.com/archives/CGB0QHWSW/p1650331073409229):
I was trying the Delta Lake connector. I noticed that write operations are
supported for tables stored on Azure ADLS Gen2, S3 and S3-compatible storage.
Does that mean write operations are not supported for tables stored on HDFS?

_Answer:_ HDFS is always implicitly supported for data lake connectors. It isn’t
called out because it is assumed.

The confusion actually came from an error message used when the user tried to
insert into a Delta Lake table they created in Spark. Then they tried inserting
a record into the table through IntelliJ IDEA and received the following error
message:

```
Unsupported target SQL type: -155
```

They thought the problem might be the wrong data type of birthday. Then used
statement below to insert a record into the table.

```
INSERT INTO
  presto.people10m (id, firstname, middlename, lastname, gender, birthdate, ssn, salary)
VALUES (1, 'a', 'b', 'c', 'male', timestamp '1990-01-01 00:00:00 +00:00', 'd', 10);
```

However, I got an error message like this:

```
Query 20220419_031201_00015_8qe76 failed:
Cannot write to table in hdfs://masters/presto.db/people10m; hdfs not supported
```

This was an issue on the IntelliJ client.
