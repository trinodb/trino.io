## Releases 394 to 395

Official highlights from Martin Traverso:

[Trino 394]({{site.url}}/docs/current/release/release-394.html)

* JSON output format for `EXPLAIN`.
* Improved performance for `LIKE` expressions.
* `query` table function in BigQuery connector.
* `INSERT` support in BigQuery connector.
* TLS support in Pinot connector.

[Trino 395]({{site.url}}/docs/current/release/release-395.html)

* Faster `INSERT` queries.
* Better performance for large clusters.
* Improved memory efficiency for aggregations and fault tolerant execution.
* Faster aggregations over decimal columns.
* Support for dynamic function resolution.

Additional highlights worth a mention according to Cole:

* The improved performance of inserts on Delta Lake, Hive, and Iceberg is a huge
one. We're not entirely sure how much it'll matter in production use cases, but
some of the benchmarks suggested it could be massive - one test showed a 75%
reduction in query duration.
* Dynamic function resolution in the SPI is going to unlock some very neat
possibilities down the line.

More detailed information is available in the release notes for
[Trino 394]({{site.url}}/docs/current/release/release-394.html),
and

## Concept of the week: Latest features in Apache Iceberg and the Iceberg connector

It has been over a year since we had Ryan on the Trino Community Broadcast as
guest to discuss what Apache Iceberg is and how it can be used in Trino. Since
then, the adoption of Iceberg in our community has skyrocketed. Iceberg is
delivering as a much better alternative to the Hive table format.

The initial phase of the Iceberg connector in Trino aimed to provide fast and
interoperable read support. A typical usage was Trino alongside other query
engines like Apache Spark which supported many of the data modification language
(DML) SQL features on Iceberg. One of the biggest requests we got as adoption
increased was the ability to do everything through Trino. This episode dives
into some of the latest features that were missing from the early iterations of
the Iceberg connector and what has changed in Iceberg as well!

### What is Apache Iceberg?

[Iceberg](https://iceberg.apache.org/) is a next-generation table format that
defines a standard around the metadata used to map data to a SQL query engine.
It addresses a lot of the maintainability and reliability issues many engineers
experienced with the way
[Hive modeled SQL tables]({% post_url 2020-10-20-intro-to-hive-connector %})
over big data files.

One common confusion to point out is that table format is not equivalent to file
formats like ORC or Parquet. The table format is the layer that maintains
metadata mapping these files to the concept of a table and other common database
abstractions.

This episode assumes you have some basic knowledge of Trino and Iceberg already. If
you are new to Iceberg or need a refresher, we recommend the two older episodes
about Iceberg and Trino basics:

* [14: Iceberg: March of the Trinos]({{site.url}}/episodes/14.html)
* [15: Iceberg right ahead!]({{site.url}}/episodes/15.html)

### Why Iceberg over other formats?

There has been some great advancements to big data technologies that brought
back SQL and data warehouse capabilities. However, Hive and Hive-like table
formats are still missing some capabilities due to limitations that Hive tables
have, such as dropping and reintroducing stale data unintentionally. On top of
that, Hive tables require a lot of knowledge of Hive internals. Some recent
formats aim to remain backwards compatible with Hive, but inadvertently
reintroduce these limitations.

This is not the case with Iceberg. Iceberg has the most support for query
engines and puts a heavy emphasis on being a format that is interoperable. This
improves the level of flexibility users have to address a wider array of use
cases that may involve querying over a system like Snowflake or a data lakehouse
running with Iceberg. All of this is made possible by the
[Iceberg specification](https://iceberg.apache.org/spec) that all these query
engines must follow.

Finally, a great video presented by Ryan Blue that dives into Iceberg is,
"[Why you shouldn't care about Iceberg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GW3GYZK66U)."

### Metadata catalogs

Catalogs, in the context of Iceberg, refer to the central storage of metadata.
Catalogs are also used to provide the atomic compare-and-swap needed to support
[serializable isolation in Iceberg](https://iceberg.apache.org/docs/latest/reliability).
We'll refer to them as metadata catalogs to avoid confusion with Trino
[catalogs](https://trino.io/docs/current/sql/show-catalogs.html).

The two existing catalogs supported in Trino's Iceberg connector are the
[Hive Metastore Service]({{site.url}}/docs/current/connector/iceberg.html#hive-metastore-catalog)
and the AWS metastore counterpart of the Hive Metastore, Glue. While this
provides a nice migration from the Hive model, many are looking to replace these
rather cumbersome catalogs with something that's lightweight. It turns out that
the Iceberg connector only uses the Hive Metastore Service to point to top-level
metadata files in Iceberg while the majority of metadata exist in the metastore
files in storage. This makes it even more compelling to get rid of the complex
Hive service in favor of simpler services. Two popular catalogs outside of these
are the [JDBC catalog](https://iceberg.apache.org/docs/latest/jdbc) and the
[REST catalog](https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/4348).

There are two PRs in progress to support these metadata catalogs in Trino:

* [Trino PR 11772: Support JDBC catalog in Iceberg connector](https://github.com/trinodb/trino/pull/11772)
* [Trino PR 13294: Add Iceberg RESTSessionCatalog Implementation](https://github.com/trinodb/trino/pull/13294)

### Branching, tagging, and auditing, oh my!

Another feature set that is coming in Iceberg is the ability to use
[refs to alias your snapshots](https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/5364).
This would enable branching and tagging behavior similar to git and treating
the snapshot as a commit. This is yet another way that simplifies moving between
known states of the data in Iceberg.

On a related note, branching and tagging will eventually be used in the
[audit integration in Iceberg](https://tabular.io/blog/integrated-audits).
Auditing allows you to push a soft commit by making a snapshot available, but
it is not initially published to the primary table. This is achieved using Spark
and setting the `spark.wap.id` configuration property. This enables interesting
patterns like
[Write-Audit-Publish (WAP) pattern](https://www.dremio.com/subsurface/write-audit-publish-pattern-via-apache-iceberg/),
where you first write the data, audit it using a data quality tool like
[Great Expectations](https://greatexpectations.io), and lastly publish the data
to be visible from the main table. Currently, auditing has to use the
cherry-pick operation to publish. This becomes more streamlined with branching
and tagging.

### The Puffin file format

The [Puffin file format](https://iceberg.apache.org/puffin-spec) is an
alternative to [Parquet](https://parquet.apache.org/) and
[ORC](https://orc.apache.org/). This format stores information such as indexes
and statistics about data managed in an Iceberg table that cannot be stored
directly within the Iceberg manifest. A Puffin file contains arbitrary pieces of
information called “blobs”, along with metadata necessary to interpret them.

This format [was proposed](https://www.mail-archive.com/dev@iceberg.apache.org/msg03593.html)
by long-time Trino maintainer, [Piotr Findeisen @findepi](https://github.com/findepi),
to address a performance issue noted when using Trino on Iceberg. The Puffin
format is a great extension for those using Iceberg tables, as it enables better
query plans in Trino at the file level.

### pyIceberg

The [pyIceberg library](https://github.com/apache/iceberg/tree/master/python)
is an exciting development that enables users to read their data directly from
Iceberg into their own Python code easily.

### Trino Iceberg connector updates

* [`MERGE`]({{site.url}}/docs/current/sql/merge) ([PR](https://github.com/trinodb/trino/pull/7933))
* [`UPDATE`]({{site.url}}/docs/current/sql/update) ([PR](https://github.com/trinodb/trino/pull/12026))
* [`DELETE`]({{site.url}}/docs/current/sql/delete) ([PR](https://github.com/trinodb/trino/pull/11886))
* Time travel ([PR](https://github.com/trinodb/trino/pull/10258)) was initially
released in
[version 385]({{site.url}}/docs/current/release/release-385.html#iceberg-connector),
the `@` syntax for snapshots/time travel
[was deprecated](https://github.com/trinodb/trino/pull/10768) in
[version 387]({{site.url}}/docs/current/release/release-387.html#iceberg-connector),
and there were two bug fixes for this feature in versions
[386]({{site.url}}/docs/current/release/release-386.html#iceberg-connector) and
[388]({{site.url}}/docs/current/release/release-388.html#iceberg-connector).
* [Partition migration]({{site.url}}/docs/current/connector/iceberg.html#alter-table-set-properties)
([PR](https://github.com/trinodb/trino/pull/12259))
While Trino was able to read tables with these migrations applied by other query
engines, this feature allows Trino to write these changes.
* The following three features are table maintenance commands.
    * [`optimize`]({{site.url}}/docs/current/connector/iceberg.html#optimize)
([PR](https://github.com/trinodb/trino/pull/10497)) which is the equivalent to
the Spark SQL
[rewrite_data_files](https://iceberg.apache.org/docs/latest/spark-procedures/#rewrite_data_files).
    * [`expire_snapshots`]({{site.url}}/docs/current/connector/iceberg.html#expire-snapshots)
([PR](https://github.com/trinodb/trino/pull/10810)) and uses the equivalent name
in Spark.
    * [`remove_orphan_files`]({{site.url}}/docs/current/connector/iceberg.html#remove-orphan-files)
([PR](https://github.com/trinodb/trino/pull/10810)) and uses the equivalent name
in Spark.
* Iceberg v2 support ([PR1](https://github.com/trinodb/trino/pull/11880), [PR2](https://github.com/trinodb/trino/pull/12351), [PR3](https://github.com/trinodb/trino/pull/12749), [PR4](https://github.com/trinodb/trino/pull/11642), [PR5](https://github.com/trinodb/trino/pull/9881), and many more...)


Almost every release has some sort of Iceberg improvement around
[planning](https://github.com/trinodb/trino/pull/13636) or
[pushdown](https://github.com/trinodb/trino/pull/13395). If you want all the
latest features and performance improvements described here, it's important to
keep up with the latest Trino version.

## PR 13111: Scale table writers per task based on throughput

This [PR of the episode](https://github.com/trinodb/trino/pull/13111) was
contributed by Gaurav Sehgal ([@gaurav8297](https://github.com/gaurav8297)) to
enable Trino to automatically scale writers. This PR aims to the number of task
writers per worker.

You can enable this feature by setting `scale_task_writers` true in your
configuration. Its initial test results are showing a sixfold speed increase.

Thank you so much to Gaurav and all the reviewers that got this PR through!

## Demo: DML operations on Iceberg using Trino

For this demo of the episode, we use the same schema as the demo we ran in
[episode 15]({{site.url}}/episodes/15.html), and revise the syntax to
include new features.

Let's start up a local Trino coordinator and Hive metastore. Clone the
repository and navigate to the `iceberg/trino-iceberg-minio` directory. Then
start up the containers using Docker Compose.

```
git clone git@github.com:bitsondatadev/trino-getting-started.git
cd iceberg/trino-iceberg-minio
docker-compose up -d
```

Now open up your favorite Trino client and connect it to
`localhost:8080` to run the following commands:

```
/**
 * Make sure to first create a bucket names "logging" in MinIO before running
 */
CREATE SCHEMA iceberg.logging
WITH (location = 's3a://logging/');

/**
 * Create table
 */
CREATE TABLE iceberg.logging.logs (
   level varchar NOT NULL,
   event_time timestamp(6) with time zone NOT NULL,
   message varchar NOT NULL,
   call_stack array(varchar)
)
WITH (
   format_version = 2, -- New property to specify Iceberg spec format. Default 2
   format = 'ORC',
   partitioning = ARRAY['day(event_time)','level']
);

/**
 * Inserting two records. Notice event_time is on the same day but different hours.
 */

INSERT INTO iceberg.logging.logs VALUES
(
  'ERROR',
  timestamp '2021-04-01 12:23:53.383345' AT TIME ZONE 'America/Los_Angeles',
  '1 message',
  ARRAY ['Exception in thread "main" java.lang.NullPointerException']
),
(
  'ERROR',
  timestamp '2021-04-01 13:36:23' AT TIME ZONE 'America/Los_Angeles',
  '2 message',
  ARRAY ['Exception in thread "main" java.lang.NullPointerException']
);

SELECT * FROM iceberg.logging.logs;
SELECT * FROM iceberg.logging."logs$partitions";

/**
 * Notice one partition was created for both records at the day granularity.
 */

/**
 * Update the partitioning from daily to hourly 🎉
 */
ALTER TABLE iceberg.logging.logs
SET PROPERTIES partitioning = ARRAY['hour(event_time)'];

/**
 * Inserting three records. Notice event_time is on the same day but different hours.
 */
INSERT INTO iceberg.logging.logs VALUES
(
  'ERROR',
  timestamp '2021-04-01 15:55:23' AT TIME ZONE 'America/Los_Angeles',
  '3 message',
  ARRAY ['Exception in thread "main" java.lang.NullPointerException']
),
(
  'WARN',
  timestamp '2021-04-01 15:55:23' AT TIME ZONE 'America/Los_Angeles',
  '4 message',
  ARRAY ['bad things could be happening']
),
(
  'WARN',
  timestamp '2021-04-01 16:55:23' AT TIME ZONE 'America/Los_Angeles',
  '5 message',
  ARRAY ['bad things could be happening']
);

SELECT * FROM iceberg.logging.logs;
SELECT * FROM iceberg.logging."logs$partitions";

/**
 * Now there are three partitions:
 * 1) One partition at the day granularity containing our original records.
 * 2) One at the hour granularity for hour 15 containing two new records.
 * 3) One at the hour granularity for hour 16 containing the last new record.
 */

SELECT * FROM iceberg.logging.logs
WHERE event_time < timestamp '2021-04-01 16:55:23' AT TIME ZONE 'America/Los_Angeles';

/**
 * This query correctly returns 4 records with only the first two partitions
 * being touched. Now let's check the snapshots.
 */


SELECT * FROM iceberg.logging.logs;

SELECT * FROM iceberg.logging."logs$snapshots";

/**
 * Update
 */
UPDATE
  iceberg.logging.logs
SET
  call_stack = call_stack || 'WHALE HELLO THERE!'
WHERE
  lower(level) = 'warn';

SELECT * FROM iceberg.logging.logs;

SELECT * FROM iceberg.logging."logs$snapshots";

/**
 * Read data from an old snapshot (Time travel)
 *
 * Old way: SELECT * FROM iceberg.logging."logs@2806470637437034115";
 */

SELECT * FROM iceberg.logging.logs FOR VERSION AS OF 2806470637437034115;

/**
 * Merge
 */
CREATE TABLE iceberg.logging.src (
   level varchar NOT NULL,
   message varchar NOT NULL,
   call_stack array(varchar)
)
WITH (
   format = 'ORC'
);

INSERT INTO iceberg.logging.src VALUES
 (
   'ERROR',
   '3 message',
   ARRAY ['This one will not show up because it is an ERROR']
 ),
 (
   'WARN',
   '4 message',
   ARRAY ['This should show up']
 ),
 (
   'WARN',
   '5 message',
   ARRAY ['This should show up as well']
 );

MERGE INTO iceberg.logging.logs AS t
USING iceberg.logging.src AS s
ON s.message = t.message
WHEN MATCHED AND s.level = 'ERROR'
        THEN DELETE
WHEN MATCHED
    THEN UPDATE
        SET message = s.message || '-updated',
            call_stack = s.call_stack || t.call_stack;

DROP TABLE iceberg.logging.logs;

DROP SCHEMA iceberg.logging;
```

This is just the tip of the iceberg that shows the powerful `MERGE` statement
and the other features we have added to Iceberg!
