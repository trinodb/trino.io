introduction: |
  Manfred Moser and Cole Bowden are joined by Viktor Kessler and Christian Thiel
  from Vakamo who introduce us to their new metastore solution Lakekeeper. It is
  an Iceberg REST catalog-compatible lakehouse metastore with big plans for
  additional features and support for Trino. We dive into the details and have a
  look at a demo.

## Introducing Viktor and Christian

We talk with Viktor and Christian about there experience in software engineering
and the world of big data, and what led them to start Vakamo together.

## Metastores and catalogs

We talk about data lakes, data lakehouses, object storage and the role of
metadata. Details we cover include the Hive Metatstore Service, the Thrift
protocol, Amazon Glue, and the new wave of catalogs. Specifically we also talk
about Apache Iceberg and the Iceberg REST catalog standard as a basis for
Lakekeeper, and then learn all the details about Lakekeeper.
