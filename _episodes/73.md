## Releases

Following are some highlights of the recent releases:

[Trino 473]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/current/release/release-473.html)

* Add support for array literals.
* Add LDAP-based group provider.
* Remove the deprecated glue-v1 metastore type.
* Remove the deprecated Databricks Unity catalog integration.
* Remove the Kudu connector.
* Remove the Phoenix connector.

But don't use 473 since there were [some breaking changes](https://github.com/trinodb/trino/issues/25381), fixed in...

[Trino 474]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/current/release/release-474.html)

* Fix a correctness bug in `GROUP BY` or `DISTINCT` queries with a large number
  of unique groups.
* Add `originalUser` and `authenticatedUser` as resource group selectors.
* Use JDK 24 as the runtime in the Docker container. 

As always, numerous performance improvements, bug fixes, and other features were
added as well. Java 24 is coming as requirement soon - test the container!

Releases continue to be slower. Trino needs your help.

Other releases and announcements: 

* Trino Gateway 16 delayed, but Trino Gateway Helm chart 1.15.1
* Trino Helm chart with 474 -> 1.38.0
* New book: [Core Principles and Design Practices of OLAP Engines from Yiteng Xu
  and Gary Gao]({{site.baseurl}}{% post_url 2025-03-27-olap-principles-book %})
* Massive new contribution looking for helpers - [trino-query-ui](https://github.com/trinodb/trino-query-ui)

Let's explore the query ui repo a bit more...

## Application packaging and Trino

Manfred and Cole muse about the package artifacts from Trino, their history,
scope and pain points:

* RPM
* tarball
* Docker container

All of them have and had issues, and everyone knew about them. Manfred
documented a lot the usage in [Trino: The Definitive
Guide]({{site.baseurl}}/trino-the-definitive-guide). Finally some time in 2024
Manfred put some ideas down and in the last months implemented a lot of it.

We discuss a few aspects such as the following:

* Plugin architecture of Trino
* What plugins are core or optional?
* Are artifacts ready to use or not? 
* How painful is configuration?

## Demo time

In our demo session we look at some of the changes and the new trino-packages
repository:

* RPM removal from Trino, and replacement module
* trino-server-core tarball in Trino and plugin selection
* trino-server-custom module
* trinodb/trino-core:latest Docker container in Trino
* custom-docker module

Manfred runs a build, shows the results, and walks through the packages
repository structure and instruction. To finish of we talk about next steps such
as removing plugins from the default binaries and therefore making them
optional.

## Resources

* [trino-packages repository](https://github.com/trinodb/trino-packages)
* [Packaging improvement issue](https://github.com/trinodb/trino/issues/22597)
* [Trino plugin documentation]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/current/installation/plugins.html)

## Rounding out
