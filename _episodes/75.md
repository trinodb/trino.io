## Introducing Trevor

Trevor has been developing software for over 20 years and has deep knowledge of
ODBC and JDBC drivers for databases. He tells us more about his experience and
how he came to learn about Trino.

## More about insightsoftware

We untangle the long history of Simba, Logi Symphony, and insigtsoftware with
the Trino project to the current status, before we dive into the technical
details.

## ODBC and JDBC

After talking a bit about Trino, Iceberg, data lakes and related topics, we get
into the details about Simba Trino data connectivity with the ODBC and JDBC
drivers.

## Demo

Trevor shows us how you can use the ODBC driver to query Trino catalogs from
Microsoft Excel, which arguably the most widely used reporting and analytics
tool, despite really being a spreadsheet application. After that demo he moves
on to some business intelligence analytics with PowerBI.
