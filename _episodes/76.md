  AUTHORIZATION`, default column values, and `ALTER VIEW ... REFRESH`.
* Add new SQL functions like `cosine_distance()` and `to_geojson_geometry()`.

There are too many connector improvements to list them all. Check out the
release notes. Also inspect the changes on the SPI since there are quite a few.

Importantly, this release also includes some breaking changes.

As always, numerous performance improvements, bug fixes, and other features were
added as well.

## Introducing Jo and Shawn

We chat with Jo and Shawn about their background in the big data and data lake
community and beyond. 

## Collate

We talk about the [OpenMetadata open source project](https://open-metadata.org/)
as a unified platform for data discovery, observability, and governance, with
80+ data connectors and a collaborative interface. 

Jo and Shawn teach us about how OpenMetadata can help  build and manage high
quality data assets at scale, with case studies, documentation, and community
resources and we dive into how Collate offers a platform around OpenMetadata and
more.

## Triple platform treat

Building a modern data platform isn't just about picking tools—it's about
creating a unified ecosystem where performance, governance, and trust work
seamlessly together. See how the power trio of Trino, Collate, and Apache Ranger
transforms your data operations: 

* Trino: Lightning-fast analytics at scale. Query across any data source, any
  format, anywhere—without the complexity of data movement or vendor lock-in. 
* Collate: Intelligent data trust and discovery AI-powered profiling, automated
  quality testing, and smart alerting that keeps your data reliable and
  discoverable. 
* Apache Ranger: Enterprise-grade security and governance, fine-grained access
  controls, policy management, and audit trails that keep your data secure and
  compliant. 

The integration advantage: Watch these three platforms work together to deliver
what every data team needs—fast queries, trusted data, and bulletproof
security—all in one cohesive stack.

Jo and Shawn tell us more about "Trino + Collate + Apache Ranger = Data Platform
Excellence", talk about the components and value provided by each of them, and
dive in with a demo, while Manfred and Cole ask more questions to dive deeper.
