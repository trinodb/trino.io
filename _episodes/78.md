## Introducing Rob

Rob tells us about his history with Trino, software engineering, and management.

## A view with a view with a view

We recap Rob's past presentation and concepts from Trino Summit 2024 about views
and hierarchies of views. Then we move on to discuss all his recent development
and work. There include the
[virtual-view-manifesto](https://github.com/robfromboulder/virtual-view-manifesto)
and the [viewmapper](https://github.com/robfromboulder/viewmapper) and
[viewzoo](https://github.com/robfromboulder/viewzoo) projects.

We also chat about Rob's journey with AI tooling.

A comparison of application code access to database storage with the different
approaches of an ORM layer, a micro service and API layer, and query engine and
view layer approach:

A detailed topology of an application taking advantage of virtual view
hierarchies:

A concrete example of a view hierarchy for events -- two swappable layers, one
for mapping to physical databases, and one for calculating event priority:
