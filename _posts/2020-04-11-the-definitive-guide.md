Nearly two years ago Matt and Martin got the ball rolling on getting a book
about Presto happening. A thriving project and community like everyone around
Dain, David and Martin, the founders and creators of Presto, just needs a book.
Even in this digital age of online documentation, communities on chat and other
platforms, and videos everywhere, there is great value in a well structured and
written book. Today, we are happy to announce that our book __Presto: The
Definitive Guide__.

> ## [Get a free copy of Trino: The Definitive Guide](https://www.starburstdata.com/oreilly-presto-guide-download/?utm_campaign=O%27Reilly%20Presto%20Book&utm_source=trino.io&utm_medium=blog%20post&utm_content=main%20LP) from [Starburst](https://www.starburstdata.com) now!

This first book about Presto, is finally available for you all to get, read and
hopefully learn from.

With the help of O'Reilly, the book is now available in digital form, and paper
copies are just around the corner as well. You can find more information about
the book on [our permanent page about
it](/trino-the-definitive-guide.html).

It is based on the very recent 330 release of Presto, but applicable to any
Presto version. The book is broken up into three separate parts. No matter, if
you are beginner keen to learn, or maybe with just a bit of command line and SQL
knowledge, or an advanced or even expert Presto user, we are certain that you
can learn something from the book and encourage you to check it out.

The first part of the book establishes what Presto is, and gets you quick wins
to install a minimal setup, run it, connect to it with the CLI and an
application using the JDBC driver and run some SQL queries. 

The second part dives into the details of the Presto architecture, query
planning, connectors for all sorts of data sources and SQL usage. There is a lot
to learn and digest in these main sections.

In the third part we round things out with tuning tips, a good overview
of the Web UI, usage of other tools, security configuration and more tips to get
Presto into production.

Of course, putting all this information together requires work from many people.
And in fact we did get lots of help from members of the Presto community and
O'Reilly.

Specifically, we have some great news from our major supporter, Starburst!
Starburst allowed us to work on the book and bring it across the finish line.

And that turns out to be great news for you all as well. Not only is the book
finished now, you can also get a
