Hive ACID and transactional tables are supported in Presto since the 331
release. Hive ACID support is an important step towards GDPR/CCPA compliance,
and also towards Hive 3 support as [certain distributions](https://docs.cloudera.com/HDPDocuments/HDP3/HDP-3.1.0/hive-overview/content/hive_upgrade_changes.html)
of Hive 3 create transactional tables by default.

In this blog post we cover the concepts of Hive ACID and transactional
tables along with the changes done in Presto to support them. We also cover the
performance tests on this integration and look at the future plans for this
feature.

# How to use Hive ACID and transactional tables in Presto

Hive transactional tables are readable in Presto without any need to tweak
configs, you only need to take care of these requirements:

1. Use Presto version 331 or higher
2. Use Hive 3 Metastore Server. Presto does not support Hive transactional
tables created with Hive before version 3.

Note that Presto cannot create or write to Hive transactional tables yet. You
can create and write to Hive transactional tables via
[Hive](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/Hive+Transactions)
or via Spark with [Hive ACID Data Source plugin](https://github.com/qubole/spark-acid) and
use Presto to read these tables.

# What is Hive ACID and Hive transactional tables
Hive transactional tables are the tables in Hive that provide ACID semantics.
This excerpt from
[Hive documentation](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/Hive+Transactions)
covers ACID traits well:
> “ACID stands for four traits of database transactions:
>Atomicity (an operation either succeeds completely or fails,
>it does not leave partial data), Consistency (once an application performs an
>operation the results of that operation are visible to it in every subsequent
> operation), Isolation (an incomplete operation by one user does not cause
>unexpected side effects for other users), and Durability (once an operation is
>complete it will be preserved even in the face of machine or system failure).
>These traits have long been expected of database systems as part of their
>transaction functionality.“

# Need for Hive ACID and transactional tables
In any organisation, there is always a need to update or delete existing entries
in tables e.g., a user writes or updates the review for an item purchased a
week back or a transaction status is changed after a day, etc..
With regulations like GDPR/CCPA updates/deletes become even more frequent as the
users can ask the organisation to delete the data on them, and organisations are
obligated to fulfill these requests.

The standard practice to update data has been to overwrite the partition or
table with the updated data but this is inefficient and unreliable. It takes a
lot of resources to overwrite all of the existing data to update a few entries,
but more importantly there are issues around isolation when reads on old data
are going on and the overwrite starts deleting that data. To solve these issues
several solutions have been developed, many of them are covered
[in this blog post](https://www.qubole.com/blog/qubole-open-sources-multi-engine-support-for-updates-and-deletes-in-data-lakes/),
and Hive ACID is one of them.

# Concepts of Hive ACID and transactional tables

Several concepts like transactions, WriteIds, deltas, locks, etc. are added in
Hive to achieve ACID semantics. To understand the changes done in Presto to
support Hive ACID and transactional tables, covered in the next section, it is
important to understand these concepts first. So let's look at them in detail.

## Types of Hive transactional tables
There are two types of Hive transactional tables: Insert-Only transactional
tables and CRUD transactional tables.
Following table compares the two:

| Type of transactional table     | Hive DML Operations Supported | Input Formats supported | Synthetic columns in file? | Additional Table Properties   |
|:-------------------------------:|:--------------------------:|:-------------------------:|:----------------------------:|:-----------------------------:|
|Insert-Only Transactional Tables | INSERT                     | All input formats         |    No                        | `'transactional'='true'`, `'transactional_properties'='insert_only'` |
| CRUD Transactional Tables       | INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE     | ORC                       |    Yes                       | `'transactional'='true'` |

## Hive Transactions
Hive transactional tables should be accessed under Hive Transactions only. Note that
these transactions are different from Presto transactions and are managed by
Hive. Running DML queries under separate transactions helps in atomicity. Each
transaction is independent and when rolled back will not have any impact on the
state of the table.

## WriteIds
DML queries under a transaction write to a unique location under partition/table
described in detail later in "New Sub-Directories" section. This location is derived
by WriteId allocated to the transaction. This provides Isolation of DML queries
and such queries can run in parallel, whenever they can, without interfering
with each other.

## Valid WriteIds
Read queries under a transaction get a list of valid WriteIds that belong to the
transactions which were successfully committed. This ensures Consistency by
making results of committed transactions available to all the future
transactions and also provides Isolation as DML and read queries can run in
parallel with read queries not reading partial data written by DML queries.

## New Sub-Directories
Results of a DML queries are written to a unique location derived from WriteId
of the transaction. These unique locations are delta directories under
partition/table location. Apart from the WriteId, this unique location is made
up of the DML operation and depending on the operation type there can be two
types of delta directories:
1. Delete Delta Directory: This delta directory is created for results of
DELETE statements and is named `delete_delta_<writeId>_<writeId>` under
partition/table location.
2. Delta Directory: This type is created for the results of INSERT statements
and is named `delta_<writeId>_<writeId>` under partition/table location.

Apart from delta directories, there is another sub-directory that is now added
called “Base directory” and is named as `base_<writeId>` under partition/table
location. This type of directory is created by INSERT OVERWRITE TABLE query or
by major compaction which is described later.

The following animation shows how these new sub-directories are created in the
filesystem along with transaction management at metastore with different
queries:

## RowID
To uniquely identify each row in the table, a synthetic rowId is created and
added to each row. RowIds are added to CRUD transactional tables only because it
is used in case of DELETE statements only. When a DELETE is performed, the
rowIds of the rows that it would delete are written into the `delete_delta`
directory and subsequents reads will read all but these rows.

RowId is made of 5 entries today: `operation`, `originalTransaction`, `bucket`,
`rowId`, `currentTransaction` but `operation` and `currentTransaction` fields
are redundant now.
RowId is added in the root STRUCT of ORC and hence the schema of ORC files is
different from the schema defined in the table, e.g.:

Schema of CRUD transactional Hive Table:
```
n_nationkey : int,
n_name : string,
n_regionkey : int,
n_comment : string
```

Schema of ORC file for this table:
```
struct {
    operation : int,
    originalTransaction : bigint,
    bucket : int,
    rowId : bigint,
    currentTransaction : bigint,
    row : struct {
        n_nationkey : int,
        n_name : string,
        n_regionkey : int,
        n_comment : string
    }
}
```

Note that one level of nesting of table schema, like the inner struct above, is
applicable to flat Hive tables too. The two level nesting of data columns is
added for Orc files of CRUD transactional tables to keep rowId columns isolated
from data columns.

## Compactions
The working described above with `delta` and `delete_delta` directories for each
transaction makes the DML queries execute fast but have
the following impact on read queries:
1. Many delta directories with small data in each directory will slow down
execution of read queries. This is a known problem around
small files where engines end up spending more time opening files than actually
processing the data.
2. Cross referencing all `delete_delta` directories to remove all deleted rows
slows down the reads.

To solve these problems, Hive compacts delta directories asynchronously at two
levels:
1. Minor Compaction: This compaction combines active `delta` directories into one
`delta` directory and active `delete_delta` directories into one `delete_delta`
directory thereby decreasing the number of small files. Limiting scope of this
compaction to combining only `delta` directories keeps it fast. Minor compaction
is automatically triggered as soon as active delta directories count reaches
10 (configurable). This compaction creates new delta directories like
`delta_<start_write_id>_<end_write_id>` where [start_write_id, end_write_id]
gives the range of existing delta directories that we compacted. Similar naming
convention is used for `delete_delta` directory.
2. Major Compaction: Minor compaction does not work on merging base, `delta` and
`delete_delta` directories as that requires rewriting of data with only the
non-deleted rows, hence time consuming. This work is handled by a separate, less
frequent and longer running, compaction called Major compaction. Major
compaction is triggered when the total size of delta directories reaches
10% (configurable) of the base directory size. This compaction creates a new
Base directory.

## Locks
Hive uses shared locks to control what operations can run in parallel on
partition/table. For example, DML queries take a write-lock on partitions they
are modifying while read queries take a read-lock on partitions they are
reading. The read-locks taken by read queries prevents Hive from cleaning up the
delta directories that have been compacted while they are being read by the
query.

# Changes in Presto to support Hive ACID and transactional ables

At high level, there are changes at two places in Presto to support Hive ACID
and transactional tables: In split generation logic that runs in coordinator and
in ORC reader that is used in workers.

## Split generation

1. Hive ACID State is setup in `SemiTransactionalHiveMetastore.beginQuery`,
only for Hive transactional tables:
    1. A new Hive transaction is opened per Query
    2. A shared read-lock is obtained from Metastore server for the partitions
    read in the query
    3. A Heartbeat mechanism is set up to inform the Metastore server about
    liveliness periodically. Frequency of heartbeats is figured out from the
    Metastore server but can be overridden with `hive.transaction-heartbeat-interval`
    property.
2. `BackgroundSplitLoader` is set up with valid WriteIds for the partitions as
provided by Metastore server
3. `BackgroundSplitLoader.loadPartitions` is called in an Executor to create
splits for each partition:
    1. ACID sub-directories: `base`, `delta` and `delete_delta` directories are
    figured out by listing the partition location
    2. `DeleteDeltaLocations`, a registry of `delete_delta` directories, is
    created. It contains minimal information through which `delete_delta`
    directory paths can be recreated at workers.
    3. HiveSplits are created with each location of base and delta directories.
    Each HiveSplit contains the `DeleteDeltaLocations`
    4. If the table is Insert-Only transactional table then
    `DeleteDeltaLocations` is empty and the HiveSplit is same as the HiveSplit
    on flat/non-transactional Hive table

## Reading Hive transactional data in workers

The HiveSplit generated during the split generation phase make their way to
worker nodes where OrcPageSourceFactory is used to create PageSource for
TableScan operator.
1. Insert-Only transactional tables are read in the same way a non-transactional
tables are read, `OrcPageSource` is created for their splits which reads the
data for the split and makes it available to TableScanOperator
2. CRUD transactional tables need special handling during reads because the file
schema does not match the table for them due to the synthetic RowId column added
which introduces additional Struct nesting as mentioned earlier:
    1. RowId columns are added to the list of columns to be read from file
    2. ORC reader is setup by accessing column name from the file instead of
    using the column indexes from table schema, equivalent to forcing
    `hive.orc.use-column-names=true` for CRUD transactional tables
    3. `OrcRecordReader` is created for the ORC file of the split
    4. `OrcDeletedRows` is created for `delete_delta` locations, if any.
    5. `OrcPageSouce` is created that returns rows from `OrcRecordReader`
    which are not present in `OrcDeletedRows`. This cross referencing of deleted
    rows is done lazily for each `Block` of the `Page` only when that `Block` is
    needed to be read from the PageSource. This works well with the lazy
    materialization logic of Presto to skip over Blocks if a predicate does not
    apply to the `Page` at all.

# Performance numbers
Each Insert on Hive transactional table can create additional splits for `delta`
directories and each delete can create `delete_delta` directories that adds
additional work of cross referencing deleted rows while reading the split. To
measure the impact of these operations on reads from Presto we ran the following
performance tests where multiple Hive transactional tables are created with
varying number of Insert and Delete operations and runtime of different
read-focused Presto queries were recorded:

| Table Type                   | Description                                                                                                                            | delta directories | delete_delta directories |
|:----------------------------:|:--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------:|:-----------------:|:------------------------:|
| Flat                         | TPCDS store_sales scale 3000 table, 8.6B rows                                                                                          | 0                 | 0                        |
| Only Base                    | Hive transactional store_sales scale 3000 table: 8.6B rows                                                                             | 0                 | 0                        |
| Base + 1-Delete              | Derived from “Only Base” with rows having customer_id=100 deleted by 1 DELETE query: 347 deleted entries                               | 0                 | 1                        |
| Base + 1-Delete + 1-Insert   | Derived from “Base + 1 Delete” with deleted rows added back by 1 INSERT query: 347 deleted entries + 347 inserted entries              | 1                 | 1                        |
| Base + 5-Deletes             | Derived from “Only Base” with rows for 5 customer_ids deleted by 5 DELETE queries: 1355 rows deleted                                   | 0                 | 5                        |
| Base + 5-Deletes + 5-Inserts | Derived from “Base + 1 Delete” with deleted rows added back by 5 INSERT queries: 1355 deleted entries + 1355 inserted entries          | 5                 | 5                        |

Following is the result of these tests, ran on a cluster with 5 c3.4xlarge
machines on AWS:
![](/assets/blog/hive-acid/perf.png)

It was seen that there is an impact of deleted rows on read performance, which
is expected as the work for the reader increases in this case. But with
predicates in place, this impact was reduced as the amount of data to be read
goes down.

# Ongoing and Future work
There has been ongoing work on the Hive ACID integration and some improvements
are planned in future, notably:
* Bucketed Hive transactional table support has been added ([#1591]({{site.github_repo_url}}/pull/1591))
* Support for original files is in progress ([#2930]({{site.github_repo_url}}/pull/2930)),
this will allow Presto to read the Hive tables that were converted to
transactional table at some point after having non-transactional data
* Write support will be taken up in future ([#1956]({{site.github_repo_url}}/issues/1956))
* There is ongoing work on Hive side for ACID on Parquet format. Once that
lands, Presto’s implementation will be extended to support Parquet too.

# Acknowledgements and Conclusion
Thanks to the folks who helped out in the development of this feature:
[Abhishek Somani](https://www.linkedin.com/in/abhishek-somani-a946aa1b) provided
continuous guidance on internals of Hive ACID,
[Dain](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dainsundstrom) helped out with simplifying
ORC reader and along with [Piotr](https://www.linkedin.com/in/piotrfindeisen/)
helped in code refinement and with multiple rounds of reviews.

While we continue development on this feature to get full fledged support
including writes, you can start using it on Hive transactional tables which do
not have files in flat format. If you have such tables and want to use Presto
with them then you can apply [this fix]({{site.github_repo_url}}/pull/2930)
to your Presto installation or you can trigger a  major compaction on all
partitions to migrate full table into CRUD transactional table format.
