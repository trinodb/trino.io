You have read our book [Trino: The Definitive Guide]({% post_url
2020-04-11-the-definitive-guide %}), practiced with various SQL examples, and
consulted our [Presto documentation]({{site.url}}/docs). Great steps to
become a Presto and SQL expert. However, learning efficient and advanced SQL can
take years of experience. Luckily we have some help from an expert coming your
way.

Join us for a free webinar **Advanced SQL in Presto** with David Phillips.

Update:

With nearly 200 live attendees and a two hour session we ended with lots of
questions from the engaged audience. After 20 minutes overtime we wrapped up the
successful event. Check out the presentation slides and the recording:
