With the help of [David's training about advanced SQL]({% post_url
2020-07-15-training-advanced-sql %}) you composed a number of useful queries.
You gain valuable insights from the resulting data. However these complex
queries take time to run. If only you could make them run faster. I think we
have just what you need coming up. 

Join us for a free webinar **Understanding and Tuning Presto Query Processing**
with Martin Traverso.

Update:

We are delighted that such an advanced topic attracted close to 150 attendees.
Everyone learned a lot and many additional questions came up during class and in
the Q&A overtime. Take advantage of the slides and recording to recapture, or if

In our new [Presto Training Series](https://bit.ly/2NO26Cm) we give Presto users
an opportunity to learn advanced skills from the co-creators of Presto –
[David Phillips](https://github.com/electrum), 
[Martin Traverso](https://github.com/martint) and 
[Dain Sundstrom](https://github.com/dain). Beyond the basics, each of the four 
training sessions covers critical topics for scaling Presto to more users and
use cases. 

In this training session Martin helps to understand how Presto executes query.
That knowledge can help you improve query performance. For instance, the explain
plan is a powerful tool, but reading the plans and make sense of them can be
overwhelming. We explore how to create an explain plan for you query and how to
read it. We look at the work the cost-based optimizer performs and how you can
potentially help Presto run your queries even faster. This session covers to
following topics:

* Explain the EXPLAIN
* Learn how queries are analyzed and executed
* Understand what the optimizer does, including some of its limitations
* Showcase the cost-based optimizer
