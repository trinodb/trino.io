In our new [Presto Training Series](https://bit.ly/2NO26Cm) we give Presto users
an opportunity to learn advanced skills from the co-creators of Presto –
[David Phillips](https://github.com/electrum), 
[Martin Traverso](https://github.com/martint) and

covers the following topics:

* Cluster configuration and node sizing
* Memory configuration and management
* Improving task concurrency and worker scheduling
* Tuning your JVM configuration
* Investigating queries for join order and other criteria
* Tuning the cost-based optimizer
