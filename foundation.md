### Commitment to open source

As detailed in the our [legal notices](./legal.html) all projects use the Apache
License 2.0. The Trino Software Foundation is committed to continue using the
Apache License 2.0 as a liberal license to ensure the widest possible adoption
of Trino by users and vendors alike.

### Non-commercial but aware and friendly

The TSF is happy to have third parties, including for-profit corporations, take
our software and use it for their own purposes. However it is important in these
cases to ensure that the third party does not misuse the brand and reputation of
the Trino projects for its own purposes. It is important for the longevity and
community health of Trino that the community gets the appropriate credit for
producing freely available software.

We encourage contributions from vendors with proprietary modifications and
appreciate any further [sponsorship and support](./sponsor.html).
