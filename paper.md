# Abstract

Presto is an open source distributed query engine that supports much of the SQL
analytics workload at Facebook. Presto is designed to be adaptive, flexible,
and extensible. It supports a wide variety of use cases with diverse characteristics.
These range from user-facing reporting applications with sub-second latency
requirements to multi-hour ETL jobs that aggregate or join terabytes of data.
Presto’s Connector API allows plugins to provide a high performance I/O interface
to dozens of data sources, including Hadoop data warehouses, RDBMSs, NoSQL systems,
and stream processing systems. In this paper, we outline a selection of use cases
that Presto supports at Facebook. We then describe its architecture and implementation,
and call out features and performance optimizations that enable it to support these
use cases. Finally, we present performance results that demonstrate the impact of our
main design decisions.
