Perform fast interactive analytics against different data sources using the
Trino high-performance distributed SQL query engine. In the second edition of
this practical guide, you'll learn how to conduct analytics on data where it
lives, whether it's a data lake using Hive, a modern lakehouse with Iceberg or
Delta Lake, a different system like Cassandra, Kafka, or SingleStore, or a
relational database like PostgreSQL or Oracle.

Analysts, software engineers, and production engineers learn how to manage, use,
and even develop with Trino and make it a critical part of their data platform.
Authors Matt Fuller, Manfred Moser, and Martin Traverso show you how a single
Trino query can combine data from multiple sources to allow for analytics across
your entire organization.

Get started: Explore Trino's use cases and learn about tools that help you
connect to Trino for querying and processing huge amounts of data

Go deeper: Learn Trino's internal workings, including how to connect to and
query data sources with support for SQL statements, operators, functions, and
more

Put Trino in production: Deploy and secure Trino at scale, monitor workloads,
tune queries, and connect more applications; Learn how other organizations apply
Trino successfully
